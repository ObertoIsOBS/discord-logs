# Getting Started
We have made it as easy and simple as possible for you to setup Discord Logs.
## Setting the Log Channel

> First, make sure that Discord Logs has the following permissions:
>> VIEW_CHANNELS
>> READ_MESSAGES
>> VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS
>> SEND_MESSAGES
>> EMBED_LINKS
>> MANAGE_ROLES
>> MANAGE_GUILD *not nessacary but does help things run smoother*

Next, create the channel you want logs to be sent to.
Now, run the following command and replace #channel with your channel. *Make sure you actually mention the channel.*
```~channel #channel```
